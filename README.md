# Searching for A Data Scientist jobs in Data Scientist's Style?

I scrapped 1000 data from a job website for Data Scientist Job in the UK. These are my findings: 

- 499 jobs (of 1025)  are located in London
- 348 job posts (of 968) did not reveal the salary 
- Most of the jobs are permanent and fulltime
- 452 job posts mentioned "Python", 43 mentioned "R" and 67 mentioned both "Python and R" programming languages.

I am not claiming the samples I scrapped are completely random as it depends on the search result, or how this website shows the result when someone searches for "Data Scientist" on their site.
