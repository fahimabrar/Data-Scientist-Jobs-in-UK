Route two: Far more interesting and offers greater job security. If you want to achieve an outstanding career highlight, this opportunity may just be your cup of tea.

We are an effective, efficient and impartial tax and payments authority with a vital purpose: To collect the money that pays for the UK's public services and help families and individuals with targeted financial support.

We work primarily in two areas, one is Personalisation and Pricing, and the other is Network Efficiency (making sure our network is running well). We have a data lake and all the data starts in SQL. We work primarily on the GCP stack, however, experience in any azure/aws/gcp valuable.Our client is one of the UK's leading names in the telecommunications sector with sites based around the UK. This role will allow you to work from home (in the UK) with a proviso that some on site visits may be required during the course of your contract. What you will be doingThis role is a hands-on role working across multiple programs of working including personalisation, operations and network data science capabilities. You'll be building ML models and writing code in real time services powering digital products (website and apps), our marketing capabilities, network efficiency and ensuring our operations are running optimally. A normal week might look like writing prediction models, digging into data to look for opportunities, implementing code for production services, doing code reviews for junior members, working with an established data engineering / ML Ops team to determine platform choices for data scientists to be most efficient and effective. You'll work with stakeholders to determine how data science can optimize their processes, and then work with the wider team to bring those solutions to fruition. Experience in cloud technologies in some manner is expected, as you'll be expected to give guidance to more junior members of the team on optimal methods for interacting with these. You'll feed requirements and suggestions into the current state of technologies and help to choose new ones as well, but primarily we build in house.What they are looking forApply for this job if you are a data scientist or ML engineer working on production ML backed services and looking to take the next step in your career, or a senior who is looking to broaden your experience and further develop your technical skills. You'll join a great team of product managers, software and ML engineers, data analysts and analyst engineers and data scientists! We aren't hiring ML Ops, only Data Science / ML Engineering - we want the people who write the code, who do the modelling. There are other people in our team who keep the platform up and move data around. Experience applying knowledge in statistics and machine learning to real world commercial problems. Experience bringing live services using machine learning and python to production. Expert knowledge of Python and relevant libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc…) knowledge in other programming languages is valuable, but this is primarily a Python shop. Experience with things like CI/CD pipelines, Docker or similar, cloud hosting, good software engineering practices - we have an ML Ops team but as a principal you need to be familiar with why these things are good and how to use/do them. Experience working in an agile software development environment. Strong mathematics or statistics background gained through MSc/PhD education in scientific field / computer science. Ability to translate consumer business problems into data science use cases and requirementsWhat you'll get in returnFlexible working options available. The roles have been determined as Inside IR35 and are offered on a 6 month initial contract with scope for extension. The day rate will be a maximum of £625 per day via an approved Umbrella company.If this sounds like you then click apply now!I am a Senior Business Manager for Hays Technology, specialising in Project Management/Change Management for the Surrey and North Hampshire area, helping tech professionals develop their careers and ensuring organisations are supported by the top talent.

About Schroders We're a global investment manager. We help institutions, intermediaries and individuals around the world invest money to meet their goals, fulfil their ambitions, and prepare for the future. We have around 5,000 people on six continents. And we've been around for over 200 years, but keep adapting as society and technology changes. What doesn't change is our commitment to helping our clients, and society, prosper. Technology at Schroders There's a huge amount of change going on at Schroders. Technology's shaping our business more and more, so there are many opportunities waiting to be grabbed. And because we're a big financial player, we can put hefty backing behind good ideas. We're a serious business - we have enormous responsibilities to our clients and shareholders. But just because we're suited and booted, that doesn't make us stuffy; our tech teams are friendlier and more informal than you might expect. The base We moved into our new HQ in the City of London in 2018. We're close to our clients, in the heart of the UK's financial centre. And we have everything we need to work flexibly. The team The Data Insights Unit (DIU)'s mission is to bring scientific rigour to all business decisions in Schroders. In essence we do this by: 1. making available alternative data sources, 2. unlocking the value in data by providing a research service, answering business questions by analysing these datasets, 3. scaling the value in data by building Insight Products: generalising those analyses or anticipating those questions by alerting people to relevant changes before they know to ask. Through all these we use specialist Data Science tools and techniques: cloud technologies, machine learning, statistical techniques, and insights from the world of behavioural science. The quantity of information available for investment research purposes is increasing at such a rate that traditional industry practices and skillsets are unable to absorb and process it. Global trends in digitalisation, social media, open data and technology are all creating vast streams of alternative data that are often highly unstructured and obscure. However, they contain valuable and often rare insights. The DIU aims to find these new and potentially unorthodox datasets, extract the rich, hidden information they contain and use their expertise to improve traditional fundamental research. Data Science Engineering team supports those goals by providing Data Science Platform and capabilities to delivery full life-cycle of an Insight Product - this includes insight discovery and development, its management as well as consumption. In addition to platform and shared services we also contribute directly to product development by embedding withing cross functional product teams.

1003,"Vice President, Data Operations Program Manager - EDI",Competitive salary,South East England,London,"Permanent,full-time","Apply on employer's website Description About this role About the role When BlackRock was started in 1988, its founders envisioned a company that combined the best of financial services with powered by technology. BlackRock has become a FinTech platform in the years since â€"" for investment management and technology services for thousands of users around the world. Data is at the heart of everything we do.Â We are responsible for building and maintaining a cutting-edge data platform that provides quality data for to all users of the Aladdin platform, including investors, operations staff, data scientists, other applications and engineers. Organizational Overview Data is at the core of the Aladdin platform and our ability to consume, store, analyze and gain insight from data is a key component of our competitive advantage. Our goal is to provide highly available, consistent, high quality data to our clients, while evolving our platform to enable growth at scale. We are driving a major transformation of the entire data supply chain for the firm, while operating the existing pipeline.Â We face daunting challenges in aligning decisions in both data operations and technology across the firm so that we can design, develop, and deploy the new platform without a hitch. To accomplish this, we have created a portfolio of programs.Â Some programs own elements of the data supply chain, others own functions that span the entire supply chain.Â The programs intersect at specific points but are designed to work in parallel and independently deliver incremental benefit to clients and the firm.Â All programs follow our â€œOne Programâ€ principle:Â there is one and only one program for the data supply chain, and it covers the scope of process and technology holistically.Â Program participants may belong to different organizations, but they speak with one voice and coordinate work via one program. Program Manager Role Overview The Program Manager is responsible for one or more programs in the portfolio.Â He or she provides: Â 1) program leadership; 2) strategic planning; 3) structure for workstreams; 4) steering committee updates; 5) program management â€"" all within an agile development framework that spans operations and engineering as well as adjacencies such as the Aladdin product group, risk, quantitative modeling, and data science teams.Â All participants in the program are seconded to the program and are under the direction of the program manager for program-related work.
